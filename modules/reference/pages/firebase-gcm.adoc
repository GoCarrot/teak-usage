IMPORTANT: Make sure that **Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)** is enabled; those are the settings that Teak uses.

The value in `Sender ID` is used for your `FCM Sender ID` in the Teak Dashboard.

The value in `Server key` is used as your `FCM Api Key` in the Teak Dashboard.

NOTE: Be sure to click `Save` after you are finished updating the settings for your game in the Teak Dashboard.
