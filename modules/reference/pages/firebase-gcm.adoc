= Finding your Android Push Credentials on Firebase

== Before you Begin

Before you begin, you will need the following

* An account on the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] with access to your game
* An account on https://app.teak.io/login[Teak, window=_blank] with access to your game

== Navigating the Firebase Console

To find the credentials for Android push configuration when using Firebase, go to your Firebase Dashboard and click the gear icon in the upper left corner, and click **Project settings**.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that **Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)** is enabled; those are the settings that Teak uses.

The value in `Sender ID` is used for your `FCM Sender ID` in the Teak Dashboard.

The value in `Server key` is used as your `FCM Api Key` in the Teak Dashboard.

NOTE: Be sure to click `Save` after you are finished updating the settings for your game in the Teak Dashboard.
