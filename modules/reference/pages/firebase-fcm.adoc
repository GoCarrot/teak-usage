= Firebase Cloud Messaging (v1) Credentials Guide
:page-aliases: ../firebase-gcm.adoc
:!page-pagination:

In order to send notifications to your game on Android, Teak needs your Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM V1) credentials.  

In this guide, we'll download a Service Account Key (in JSON format), and copy the Sender ID value from your Firebase console, and input those into Teak. 

[NOTE]
====
If you already have FCM (Legacy) setup with Teak, please see our xref:usage:reference:page$firebase-fcm-v1-migration.adoc[Firebase (v1) Migration guide] for instructions on ensuring a smooth rollover from Legacy credentials to v1 credentials.
====

**You will need the following accounts to complete this step:**

* [*] An account on the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] with an Editor or Owner role and access to your game
* [*] An account on https://app.teak.io/login[Teak, window=_blank] with access to your game

== Open menu:Project Settings[Cloud Messaging] in your Firebase project.

. Go to your https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] and **open the project** for your game. This must be the same project that you are using to authenticate the Firebase SDK in your game. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you need to confirm that you have the correct Firebase project: Open the `google-services.json` file from your Unity Project and find the `project_number`. Confirm that the value matches the `Sender ID` value on the menu:Cloud Messaging[] tab.
