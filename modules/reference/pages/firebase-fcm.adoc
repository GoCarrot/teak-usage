= Copy your Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Credentials to Teak
:page-aliases: ../firebase-gcm.adoc

In order to send notifications to your game on Android, Teak needs your Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) credentials. These can be found on the Firebase console. 

We will be copying the values from the Firebase Console and pasting them in the Teak Dashboard. 

**You will need the following accounts to complete this step:**

* [*] An account on the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] with an Editor or Owner role and access to your game
* [*] An account on https://app.teak.io/login[Teak, window=_blank] with access to your game

== Find your Android Push Credentials on Firebase

. Go to your https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] and **open the project** for your game. 

. Click the **gear icon** in the upper left corner, and click **Project settings**.
