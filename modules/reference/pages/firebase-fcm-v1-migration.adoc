= Migrate to Firebase Cloud Messaging (v1) from FCM (Legacy)
:!page-pagination:

If you have previously integrated Teak on Android, you most likely have FCM (Legacy) credentials set up. To continue using push on Android, we now need to setup Firebase Cloud Messaging (v1). 

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Push notifications will stop working on Android if this migration is not completed.**

On June 20th, 2024, Google will discontinue support for Cloud Messaging API (Legacy). All Android games need to migrate to Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1) to continue using Push Notifications.
====

This guide will help you seemlessly transition to the (v1) credentials with no disruption to your push notification sends on Android.

The required steps can be done in the Teak and Firebase dashboards. No client update is required.

**You will need the following to complete this step:**

* [*] A game with **Firebase Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)** setup in Teak. 
* [*] An account on the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank] with an Editor or Owner role and access to your game
* [*] An account on https://app.teak.io/login[Teak, window=_blank] with access to your game
* [*] An Android test device that can recieve push notifications for your game

[NOTE]
====
If you __do not__ have FCM (Legacy) setup in Teak, you can skip this migration guide and simply  xref:usage:reference:page$firebase-fcm.adoc[Setup FCM (v1) Credentials] without the rollout process.
====

== Locate the correct Firebase project for your game.

It is important that we use the same project in Firebase that is currently setup for FCM (Legacy). 

. In the **https://app.teak.io[Teak Dashboard, window=_blank]** for your game, navigate to menu:Settings[Android].

. Click **Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging (V1)** to open the FCM setup modal. 
+
The modal shows the __FCM (Legacy) sender ID__ that needs to match the `Sender ID` in Firebase to continue the setup. 
// +

. In the modal, click the link labeled, **'Service accounts' tab in your Firebase Console**. This will open the Firebase Console to the correct project for your game.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you do not have access to this Firebase page, __you will need to get access to this project__ in order to continue.
====

== Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1), (if it isn't already enabled).

[start=4]
. Click on the **Cloud Messaging** tab in your Firebase Project Settings.

. Make sure that **Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)** is enabled. Support for FCM (Legacy) will be discontinued by Google on June 20th, 2024. 

+
[TIP]
.Enabling Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)
====
If the V1 API isn't enabled, proceed with these steps to activate it.

.. In the **Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)** section, click on the **3 vertical dots**. &vellip;

.. Click **Manage API in Google Cloud Console**.

.. In the new tab that opens, click **Enable**. 

.. This will load the __API/Service Details__ page. After the page has loaded, **close this tab.**

.. Return to the **Firebase Console** page and **refresh** the page.

.. **Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)** should now be **enabled**.

== Copy the __Sender ID__ to Teak 

[start=6]
. Confirm that the `Sender ID` from Firebase matches the existing `FCM Sender ID` in Teak. 

. If the IDs match, copy **`Sender ID`** from Firebase to the **`FCM Sender ID`** field in the setup modal.

Leave the modal open for the next step.

== Generate a __Service Account Key__ in Firebase

[start=8]
. Back in the Firebase dashboard, click the **Service accounts** tab.
+
image::usage:reference:firebase-setup/firebase-service-accounts.png[]

. By default, the **Firebase Admin SDK** service account will be selected. This is fine for most cases. 

. Click the **Generate new private key** button and confirm you want to **Generate key** in the popup. This will download a `private key` as a `JSON` file. 

== Upload the __Service account private key__ to Teak 

[start=10]
. Return to the Teak dashboard. The FCM setup modal should still be open.

. Click the **Select private key file (JSON)** and locate the private key 

. Click **Save** to confirm your changes.

If this is not a Production environment on Teak, you are done. Proceed to your normal testing to make sure everything is working. If this is a Production build, then there's a few more steps to take to make sure we don't break anything.

== Extra Steps for Production builds 

For Production environments, we want to make sure the new credentials are working before we rollover to the new credentials. 

=== Preview a test notification

After you save, you will see that 

[start=14]
. In a new tab, send yourself a **Preview Notification** to your Android device. 
+
See xref:unity::page$quickstart/hello-world.adoc[Sending Your First Notification, window=_blank] for directions on setting up and sending previews notifications.

. When the Teak detects that there were no errors with your preview send, you will see **Preview Successful!** in the setup modal. 
+
[NOTE]
====
This will work without an app update. The credentials are used in the backend, so no client update is required. 
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
.Troubleshooting
====
If things are not sending properly, the most likely cause downloading a key from the wrong Firebase project. Double check your project ID and sender ID match the one in Teak and the values in your `google-services.json` file in your Unity build. 
====

=== Begin Rollout

[start=16]
. With the Preview send confirmed, it's time to click **Begin Rollout**. 
+
The modal outlines the process: 

* Teak will start sending 1% of sends through FCM (v1). 
* If sends continue to work properly, Teak will direct an additional 1% of sends each hour until the game has fully rolled over to FCM (v1). 
* It should take approximately 4 days for the full rollout to complete. 

. If your game has notification sends going out, you will see the **"successful sends"** number increasing every minute. 
+
**Teak will monitor the error rate. If it appears abnormal, the rollout will be canceled.**

=== Wait 4 days...

__... FOUR DAYS LATER...__

[start=18]
. In the **https://app.teak.io[Teak Dashboard, window=_blank]** again, navigate to menu:Settings[Android]. The progress bar will be gone when it's all done.

. **Congratulations**, you did the thing that Google is making us all do. Rest easy when you get the ominous warning emails about FCM (Legacy) being discontinued. Hooray!
