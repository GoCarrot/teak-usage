= Making Notification Text 🅵🅰🅽🅲🆈
:page-aliases: usage:reference:notification-markup.adoc

== iOS

On iOS you can use 𝕦𝕟𝕚𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖 𝖙𝖗𝖎𝖈𝖐𝖘 to add stylized text to your notifications. We suggest using https://texteditor.com/font-converter/[TextEditor] to stylize your text, which can then be pasted into Teak's message editor.

== Android

In addition to text from https://texteditor.com/font-converter/[TextEditor], Android supports HTML-lite tags in notification text, which can be used to apply formatting and color to your messages.

=== Supported Tags

The following tags are supported:

[horizontal]
``<b>``:: bold

``<i>``:: italic

``<tt>``:: monospace

``<u>``:: underline

``<strike>``:: strikethrough

``<font color="...">``:: change text color
