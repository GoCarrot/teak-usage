Settings is where your engineering and marketing teams will be able to control many aspects of Teak. There are many things your engineering team will fill in or provide inputs for. This is covered in the technical implementation instructions. Items like IDs, Keys, Secrets, and Certificates will need to be up-to-date in order to successfully send messages and connect to your app.

== General

=== Team

The Team panel is where you manage which members of your team have access to Teak for the current game.

==== Adding Teak Users

There are many reasons people may need access to Teak. Some may only need it on QA, Staging, or other non-production environments. Others who need to create Messages or Links will need live environment access. Coming up with an internal plan will help determine where to add users so they can successfully do their job, but not provide unnecessary access to production. There are no limits on the number of users you can have, and there are no access tiers, so it’s important to groom the list as user needs change.

==== To add a user

. Select "Settings" on the left rail
. Within the "General" Tab, you may invite users via Email.

If they have not used Teak in the past, they’ll be invited to sign up. If they are already a user on any app with the invited email address, then they will simply find a new environment available when they log in.

=== Custom Player Properties

The Custom Player Properties panel is where you manage the xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$player-properties.adoc[player properties] reported by your game, and can look up the currently set player property values for a player.

==== Accessing Custom Player Properties

. Select "Settings" on the left rail
. In the "General" Tab, scroll about halfway down the page.

Your engineering team can add Player Properties for many aspects of your game. These are separated into Strings (text) or Integers (numbers).

==== Examples of Integers

* Total number of currency
* In-game Levels
* Earned Experience.

==== Examples of Strings

* Player Nickname
* Name of the last in-game location visited
* A Favorite Item.

The name used in the code can be entered here, and then it can be used as an Audience Rule or Tag within a Message.

==== Find Player Profile
The ID you use to identify players within Teak can be entered into the "Find Player Profile" section. This will show you the properties for that specific player. This can be useful to verify information is being sent correctly, or even as a Customer Service tool.

== Facebook & Desktop Web

The Facebook & Desktop Web section is where you manage settings for:

- Facebook Canvas A2U Notifications
- Personalization for Facebook connected players
- The destination for xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$links.adoc[Links] which are clicked by players on desktop
- The destination for Web Push notifications sent on all platforms
- The Web Push badge which is used when a Web Push is sent to an Android device

=== Facebook App

The Facebook App panel is where you can control if Facebook Canvas A2U Notification should be sent, and configure your Facebook application for sending Facebook Canvas A2U notifications and personalizing notification and email content for Facebook connected players.

If you have a Facebook application and your game allows players to connect with Facebook, enter the Facebook App ID and Facebook App Secret for your application and save your settings. This will allow Teak to use xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$custom-tags.adoc#_facebook_tags[Facebook Personalization Tags] in notification and email content.

=== Desktop Links

The Desktop Links panel is where you configure a URL you want the browser to open when your links are clicked on desktop computers or when a Web Push is clicked on any platform. An entry is required for Facebook notifications, xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$links.adoc[Links], xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$email.adoc[Email], and Web Push.

=== Web Push Configuration

The Web Push Configuration panel is where you configure details specific to Web Push. Here you can upload an image to be used as the xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$notification-content.adoc#android_web_push_style[badge] for Web Push notifications sent to Android devices. An image for a badge should be a single-color PNG with transparency (alpha channel). The recommended size is 96x96 pixels.

== iOS

The iOS section is were you manage settings for:

- Sending iOS Push Notifications
- Which App Store page to take players to when they click on a xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$links.adoc[Link] on an iOS device and do not have the game installed

=== General

In the General panel you can enable or disable iOS notifications. Unchecking this box will stop all messaging from that channel from being sent. This can be helpful if there are outages or issues and is an alternative to canceling or pausing individual messages.

=== Apple Push Notification service (APNs)

In this section you can configure the required xref:ROOT:integrations:page$apple-apns.adoc[Apple Push Notification service credential] for sending iOS Push notifications.

=== Universal Links

In this section you can configure the iTunes Product ID for your application on iOS. When a player taps on a Link on an iOS device and does not have your application installed, they will be taken to the store page for the configured iTunes Product ID.

== Android

The Android section is were you manage settings for:

- Sending Android Push Notifications
- Sending Amazon Fire Notifications
- Which Play Store page to take players to when they click on a xref:ROOT:user-guide:page$links.adoc[Link] on an Android device and do not have the game installed

=== General

In the General panel you can enable or disable Android notifications. Unchecking this box will stop all messaging from that channel from being sent. This can be helpful if there are outages or issues and is an alternative to canceling or pausing individual messages.

=== Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

In this section you can configure the required xref:ROOT:integrations:page$firebase-fcm.adoc[Firebase Cloud Messaging] for sending Android Push notifications.

=== Android App Links

In this section you can configure the Android Package Name for your application on Android. When a player taps on a Link on an Android device and does not have your application installed, they will be taken to the store page for the configured Android Package Name.

In this section you can also configure your Android Certificate Fingerprints. These are values retrieved from the certificate used to sign your APK before submitting it to the play store, and are required to enable Universal Linking on Android.

=== Amazon Fire

In this section you can configure the required xref:ROOT:integrations:page$amazon-device-messaging.adoc[Amazon Device Messaging] for sending push notifications to Amazon Fire devices.

== Email

The "Email" Tab covers several necessities like Email Footer and CAN-SPAM & GDPR requirements. Filling out these fields will ensure your Emails are compliant with global regulations, while the Footer provides a consistent look and feel with options for your Social Media, as well as game and company logos.

=== Player Subscription Status

This panel allows you to determine a player’s subscription status by player ID or email address. You can find out if a player has unsubscribed, marked an email as spam, or has another subscribed or unsubscribed status. If they have unsubscribed from emails, you can resubscribe them.

=== Email Address Imports

This panel allows you to import and update email addresses for players. To begin, click the "Import Player Email List" button. You will be prompted to upload a CSV or Excel file. THe first column in the file must be the game assigned player id, the second column must be the email address to assign to the player. Note that:

* A player can only have one email address
* An email address can only be associated with one player
* Email addresses can only be assigned to players who have played your game

Teak will process your import request and email you when it is complete. The email will include an attachement describing what players had email addresses added or changed.

=== CAN-SPAM & GDPR Compliance

This panel is where you configure required information for legal compliance. You must provide a physical mailing address where you can receive written requests to opt-out of emails and process them, and links to an active privacy policy and terms of service for your game.

=== Footer

This panel is where you configure information for the default footer Teak provides when using our email templates. You can add links to your various social media channels, and logos for your game and company.

NOTE: The optimal size of Footer logos is 300 pixel x 100 pixel, but this is flexible. Generally, you should aim for approximately 3x wider than tall, and no taller than 150 pixels.

== Opt-out

The Opt-out tab is where you can configure different Opt-out Categories to allow players to opt-out of some kinds of messaging without opting out of all of your messaging. Additionally you can customize the messaging shown to players when they view their email subscription management/unsusbscribe page, which every email links to as required by law.

=== Email Unsubscribe & Opt-out Page

The messaging shown to players on the email opt-out page can be customized here. Unsubscribe Text will be seen by players who are currently subscribed and may unsubscribe from the page. Subscribe Text will be seen by players who are currently unsubscribed and may resubscribe from the page.

The logo provided for Game Logo in Footer Logos, above this section, will be displayed on the email opt-out page as well.
