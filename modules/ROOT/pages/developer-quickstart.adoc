== Server API
While most Teak features are handled by the client, some features require server integrations. We recommend starting with the xref:server-api::page$rewards/endpoint.adoc[*Reward Endpoint*] (because players love free coins), and then exploring the xref:server-api::page$index.adoc[*Server API Overview*] for a complete look at all backend offerings.

== Before You Start

Before you begin integrating Teak into your project, make sure you have:

1. **A game project** (iOS, Android, or Facebook).
2. **The ability to test new builds** on devices or simulators/emulators.
3. **Access to logs** (device console or Unity console) so you can review Teak debugging output.

== Preparing Your Game

Depending on your platform and tooling, here are some key setup points before diving into Teak-specific integrations.

=== If You Use Unity

* You only need the *Unity SDK*
* Start with xref:unity::page$quickstart/index.adoc[Getting Started with Teak in Unity]
* Or jump straight to the installation steps: xref:unity::quickstart/install-sdk.adoc[Install the Teak SDK in Unity]

=== If You Use Native iOS

* Be prepared to modify your `Info.plist`.
* Know how to add dependencies (frameworks, libraries) in Xcode.
* Download the latest iOS Native SDK
** http://sdks.teakcdn.com/ios/Teak.framework.zip
** http://sdks.teakcdn.com/ios/TeakResources.bundle.zip
* For full setup details, see xref:ios::page$integration.adoc[Integrating Teak on Native iOS].

=== If You Use Native Android

* Be prepared to modify your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
* Know how to add dependencies to your `build.gradle`.
* Download the latest Android Native SDK
** http://sdks.teakcdn.com/android/teak.aar
* For full setup details, see xref:android::page$integration.adoc[Integrating Teak on Native Android].

== Push Credentials

Push notifications are a core part of Teak. Collecting the following credentials in advance will streamline your integration and testing.

=== iOS
- A Mac and an Apple Developer account.
- Follow xref:ROOT:integrations:page$apple-apns.adoc[Apple Push Notification Service Certificates] to gather the required credentials.

=== Android
- Access to your game in the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase Console, window=_blank].
- Follow xref:ROOT:integrations:page$firebase-fcm.adoc[Finding your Android Push Credentials on Firebase] to retrieve the required configuration for FCM.

=== Amazon Devices
- Access to your game in the https://developer.amazon.com/home.html[Amazon Developer Console, window=_blank].
- Follow the xref:ROOT:integrations:page$amazon-device-messaging.adoc[Finding your Amazon Device Messaging Credentials] to set up the required credentials.

== Next Steps

Here’s a quick recap:

1. **Pick Your Platform** and follow the relevant integration guide:
   - Unity → xref:unity::page$quickstart/index.adoc[]
   - Javascript → xref:javascript::page$quickstart/index.adoc[]
   - Native iOS → xref:ios::page$integration.adoc[iOS Native Integration]
   - Native Android → xref:android::page$integration.adoc[iOS Native Integration]
2. **Secure Your Push Credentials** for iOS, Android, and/or Amazon devices.
3. **Implement Reward Endpoint** if you are responsible for server-side integrations.
