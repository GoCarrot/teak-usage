= Links

When you create a Link, a URL is generated. This URL can have a xref:usage::page$rewards.adoc[Reward, window=_blank] attached and can be clicked by a max number of players -- which you specify.

== Link Creation

Links are a straightforward way to bring people into your game. Using Teak Links for existing players provides a great way to track and incentivize them. Creating links with or without xref:usage::page$rewards.adoc[Rewards, window=_blank] is quick and easy. Plus, you can even use Deep Linking to drop them wherever you want.

=== Setting Up Links

. On the left rail select "Links"
. Click "Create a New Link"
. Give the Link a name and an optional description
. If you want to incentivize the link, add a Reward Bundle (xref:usage::page$rewards.adoc#_bundle_creation[Creating Reward Bundles, window=_blank])

By default, when a player clicks a link, they will launch your game as if they opened the app. After the normal start-up process, they will be Rewarded, if applicable. If you have Deep Linking routes set up, you can work with your engineering team to create paths that allow you to drop players directly into different areas of the game using the "Advanced Options".

NOTE: On iOS, new players will be shown the landing page when they first click the link.

New players who click a link may be able to collect the Reward on desktop, but will be routed to the appropriate App Store to install the app on mobile devices. They should be able to go back and collect the Link Reward after successfully loading into the game.

After creating the Link, you may choose to "Generate Bulk". This option appears in the Links page to the right of the individual link. From here you may generate a specific amount of individual links to be exported. This is most useful for 1:1 communication with Support, or creating a list to be uploaded into a 3rd party system for distribution. Each unique URL is single use and may only be claimed once. This eliminates the ability for players to share high value links.

=== Link Destination

Controls where the player is taken after a click or tap on a Link.

Game Launch::
Taps and clicks on the shared link will attempt to launch the game, and any associated rewards will be granted.
+
If the game is not installed on mobile devices, the player will be taken to the game listing in the appropriate app store for that device. (The app store link is based on the iTunes Product ID or Android Package Name configured in the game settings.)
+
If the shared link is clicked on a desktop device, the player will be taken to the Desktop Game URL set in the game settings.

Game Deep Link::
Direct players to a specific location in your game with a xref:unity::teak-unity-features.adoc#_deep_links[Deep Link, window=_blank] route.
+
When the player taps the shared link, the game will launch if it is installed on the device. But, instead of beginning at the default screen, players start their session in another location in the game, such as their inbox, a store, or a specific moment in their progression, and any associated rewards will be granted.
+
To use Deep Links, your team needs to integrate Teak's xref:unity::teak-unity-features.adoc#_deep_links[Deep Linking, window=_blank]. It's best practice to confirm with a developer what routes and values are available.

Out of Game URL::
Link to an out of game destination with a web URL (e.g. `https&#58;//example.com/`).
+
When the player taps the shared link on **Android** or **iOS**, the game will launch and then open the default browser to the URL. Any associated rewards will be granted before the browser is opened. When the player clicks the email link on **Desktop** the game will launch, but the player will __not__ be redirected to the Out of Game URL due to browser security restrictions.
+
This behavior can be overridden with Skip Game Open.

=== Skip Game Open

There is an option to skip the game open when opening an Out of Game URL.

When this option is enabled, the game will not be opened when the shared link is tapped or clicked on any platform. Instead, the player will be taken directly to the configured URL. Rewards cannot be granted when the game open is skipped. Clicks will be tracked, and if a player opens the game on the same device within an hour of click, they will be tracked as a xref:usage:reference:page$link-metrics.adoc#_returning_user[Returning User, window=_blank] for the Link.

=== QR Codes

All Links created in Teak come with QR codes for you to share. Depending on the configuration of the Link, Teak will provide two or three different QR code variants.

[[_qr_standard]]`Standard`:: A QR code ready to share!

[[_qr_frame]]`Frame`:: A QR code with the center cut out. You can insert any custom images or branding into the center cutout, and the QR code will still be scannable.
image::links/frame_qr.png[Frame QR Code,120,120,role=img-left]
[[_qr_coin]]`Coin`:: A QR code with a pixel art coin inserted into the center cut out. Teak only creates this variant for Links with an attached Reward Bundle. This is an example of what you can do using the center cutout.

You can view the QR codes for a Link after it is created or by selecting *View URL* from the dropdown by the Link. From the *View URL* modal you can click the *Download QR Codes* button to download full resolution versions of the QR codes. Or you can right click the displayed QR code and select *Save Image As...* to download that specific variant in full resolution.

You can also download full resolution versions of the QR codes for a Link by selecting *Download QR Codes* from the dropdown menu by the Link.
